### WebSocketBuzzer

## What is it ?

It's a personnal project to learn and understand better the use of websocket and their handling, both in python (server side) and javascript (client side)
Also, I really wanted an easy to use buzzer for me and my friends.

## How to make it work ?

You have to host the content of the **Web** folder on your website, it has been designed to be on the root.
Change the WebSocket server on every HTML file to target your websocket server's address.

Simply run the **server.py** on your websocket server.

You'll need at least Python3.10 to use it

Now, by simply going on your website, you'll be able to use the buzzer !

# Is the project over ?

No, there is plenty of things to do, and you can help me if you want to !

 - Make the installation and configuration easier (with requirements.txt, a way to set your websocket address on the client pages, ...)
 - Offer a way to not use my silly buzzer noises but only a free one
 - Make the buzzer look better
 - Any other idea to make it better !
